Prereqs
-------
1) .NET 4.0 is installed
2) NSIS has been installed (run nsis-2.46-setup.exe)


Build Steps
-----------
1) Compile Chameleon
	- run "buildChameleon.bat".  This should pop up a command prompt, use subwcrev.exe to stamp the current Subversion repository version number into Chameleon's AssemblyInfo.cs file, and execute the MSBuild project/makefile "ChameleonBuild.proj".  All output files will be put in ".\Build\input".  

2) Edit configuration file
	- The configuration file ".\Build\input\Chameleon.xml" will be installed as the default settings.  Edit this file as necessary.
	
3) Build the installer
	- With NSIS installed, right-click "ChameleonBuild.nsi" and select "Compile NSIS Script".  This should produce ".\Build\output\Chameleon[$VERSION]Setup.exe", where "[$VERSION]" is the current version major/minor together (such as "Chameleon20Setup.exe".
